I have added a folder called "Git-Resources". It contains basic information about GitHub. I highly recommend creating your own repository and practicing pushing/pulling files to see how GitHub works.

Please do not upload copyrighted content (that includes source code from a third-party source) to your branches of this repository. I'm hoping to make this repo public after the assignment is complete. Doing this will allow you all to keep this repo on your profile and showcase what our team has created this semester, along with all your contributions to the project.

Cheers.
