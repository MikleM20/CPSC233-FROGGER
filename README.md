## INTRODUCTION
The objective of this project was for our team of three to recreate, with several modifications, Atari's 1981 hit arcade game Frogger, in Java. This project fell under "Category C - Animation Application or Game" on the CPSC 233 Final Project Assignment Page. This project was completed well before the end of the 2018 summer semester deadline (within a 6 week period).
## BACKGROUND
### The Assignment
All students registered in CPSC 233 in the 2018 summer semester, were required to work in randomly assigned teams of five to complete a final project in Java worth 25% of their grade.
### The Original 1981 Frogger
The objective of the game is for the player to guide five frog avatars individually to a designated space across the screen while avoiding traffic vehicles. The frog is only allowed to move in four directions - up, down, left, and right. Players are able to control the frog via a four-key directional pad; each key push in a certain direction will cause the frog to move one spot in said direction. The player's failure to avoid said traffic vehicles while guiding one of five frogs to the designated space across the screen will cause the player to lose one of their limited lives. Losing all lives before guiding all five frogs to their designated spaces will cause the player to lose the game.
## HOW TO PLAY
I have added a folder called "Git-Resources". It contains basic information about GitHub. I highly recommend creating your own repository and practicing pushing/pulling files to see how GitHub works.

Please do not upload copyrighted content (that includes source code from a third-party source) to your branches of this repository. I'm hoping to make this repo public after the assignment is complete. Doing this will allow you all to keep this repo on your profile and showcase what our team has created this semester, along with all your contributions to the project.

Cheers.
