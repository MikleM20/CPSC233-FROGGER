## INTRODUCTION
The objective of this project was for our team of three to recreate, with several modifications, Atari's 1981 hit arcade game Frogger, in Java. This project fell under "Category C - Animation Application or Game" on the CPSC 233 Final Project Assignment Page. This project was completed well before the end of the 2018 summer semester (6 week period) deadline. Our team recieved a perfect grade of 100%, and all team members recieved a grade of "A" in the course.

## FEATURES
- A 640x480 graphical user interface (GUI) of the game programmed in Java using Swing
- WASD and Arrow Key user input
- Entirely custom sprites and game maps designed from scratch and based off of the original game
- The original sounds from the game (http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/frogger/sounds)
- A High-Score system

## HOW TO COMPILE AND PLAY
The instructions on how to compile and play the GUI and text-based versions of the game are within their respective folders ("Frogger" folder for the GUI and "FroggerTextBased" for the text-based version).

## BACKGROUND
### The Assignment
All students registered in CPSC 233 in the 2018 summer semester, were required to work in randomly assigned teams of five to complete a final project in Java worth 25% of their grade. Originally with five team members, our team was reduced to three due to unforseen circumstances.
### The Original 1981 Frogger
The objective of the original game is for the player to guide five frog avatars individually to a designated space across the screen while avoiding traffic vehicles. The frog is only allowed to move in four directions - up, down, left, and right. Players are able to control the frog via a four-key directional pad; each key push in a certain direction will cause the frog to move one spot in said direction. The player's failure to avoid said traffic vehicles while guiding one of five frogs to the designated space across the screen will cause the player to lose one of their limited lives. Losing all lives before guiding all five frogs to their designated spaces will cause the player to lose the game.
### Our Team's Re-Creation
To differentiate from the original arcade game, our re-creation does not contain five frog avatars. Instead, our re-creation contains only one frog avatar and three custom maps. The player is required to guide the frog to the designated space on all three maps to win the game. Upon reaching the designated space of one map, the game will continue onto the next map until the last map has been completed. Again, the player must avoid traffic vehicles, the water, and the user has only one life. These changes make it possible for the team, with limited programming experience, to complete the project within the 6 week time frame and allows team members to be creative with designing the custom maps. The re-creation contains a score-based system that will keep track of user high-scores.

## DEVELPOMENT/THE FUTURE
### Q: Is the game still in development?
A: as of now, no. The team members would prefer to move onto different projects at this time. However, I (Nathan Moton), see myself adding additional features to the game like a game timer, lives, bonus objects/items, and essentially looping the game like the original Frogger.
